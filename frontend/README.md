# Nishiki Frontend - Cogent Core

A cross-platform inventory management frontend built with [Cogent Core](https://cogentcore.org/core), supporting desktop, mobile, and web platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
- **Modern UI**: Native-feeling interface with Cogent Core widgets
- **Authentication**: Authentik OIDC integration
- **Inventory Management**: Full CRUD operations for groups, collections, and objects
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization with backend
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and platforms

## Architecture

This application follows the architecture specified in `FRONTEND_PLAN.md`:

### Core Components
- **Authentication Service**: Handles OIDC flow with Authentik
- **API Client**: HTTP client for backend communication
- **UI Views**: 
  - Login/Authentication
  - Dashboard with quick stats
  - Groups management
  - Collections management
  - User profile

### Design Language
The UI follows the design patterns from the original React frontend:
- **Colors**: Primary (#6ab3ab), Accent (#fcd884), Danger (#cd5a5a)
- **Layout**: Mobile-first approach with clean card-based design
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation on mobile, sidebar on desktop
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy

## Configuration

Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and update the values:

```toml
# Backend API URL
backend_url = "http://localhost:3001"

# Authentik OIDC Configuration
auth_url = "https://your-authentik-server.com"
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
redirect_url = "http://localhost:8080/auth/callback"
```

You can also use environment variables with the `NISHIKI_` prefix:
- `NISHIKI_BACKEND_URL`
- `NISHIKI_AUTH_URL`
- `NISHIKI_CLIENT_ID`
- `NISHIKI_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `NISHIKI_REDIRECT_URL`

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Linux**: X11 development libraries (`sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev`)
  - **macOS**: Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Windows**: No additional dependencies required

### Running the Application

1. Install system dependencies (Linux only):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
```

2. Install Go dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
```

### Building for Different Platforms

#### Desktop (current platform)
```bash
go build -o nishiki-frontend main.go
```

#### Web (WebAssembly)
```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o nishiki-frontend.wasm main.go
```

#### Mobile (with Cogent Core mobile tools)
```bash
# iOS
core mobile ios

# Android
core mobile android
```

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Nishiki backend via REST API:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /auth/oidc-config` - OIDC configuration
- `POST /auth/token` - Token exchange

### Data Endpoints
- `GET /groups` - User's groups
- `POST /groups` - Create group
- `GET /accounts/{id}/collections` - User's collections
- `POST /accounts/{id}/collections` - Create collection
- And more...
