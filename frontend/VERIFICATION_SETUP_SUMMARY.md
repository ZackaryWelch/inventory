## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup

```bash
cd /home/zwelch/projects/inventory/frontend
./scripts/setup-visual-verification.sh
```

This handles everything: checks, dependencies, builds, and creates helper scripts.

### One-Command Start

```bash
./scripts/start-verification.sh
```

Launches all three services and opens browsers for side-by-side comparison.

### One-Command Stop

```bash
./scripts/stop-verification.sh
```

Cleanly stops all services.

## Verification Workflow

### Method 1: Manual Verification (Recommended First)

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-verification.sh
   ```

2. **Open Checklist**
   ```bash
   cat VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
   ```

3. **Compare Side-by-Side**
   - Left browser: React (http://localhost:3000)
   - Right browser: Go WASM (http://localhost:PORT)
   - Work through each checklist item
   - Mark ✅ (perfect), ⚠️ (close), or ❌ (fail)

4. **Document Results**
   - Fill out the checklist
   - Note any discrepancies
   - Take notes on issues found

### Method 2: Automated Verification (For Precision)

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-verification.sh
   ```

2. **Capture Screenshots**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/capture-screenshots.sh
   ```
   - Follow interactive prompts
   - Navigate to each screen when prompted
   - Click browser window to capture

3. **Generate Comparison**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/compare-screenshots.sh
   ```
   - Automatically compares all screenshots
   - Generates diff images
   - Creates detailed report

4. **Review Results**
   ```bash
   cat verification/reports/comparison-*.md
   ```
   - Check difference percentages
   - Review diff images in `verification/screenshots/diff/`
   - Identify issues to fix

### Method 3: Combined Approach (Best)

1. Do manual verification first to catch obvious issues
2. Fix any critical problems
3. Do automated verification for pixel-perfect validation
4. Use reports to track progress over iterations

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Completion Requirements

To mark Phase 1 (Foundation) as complete:

- [ ] All critical screens match exactly (< 2% difference)
- [ ] Important screens match closely (< 5% difference)
- [ ] VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md is fully completed
- [ ] All issues are documented
- [ ] Screenshots archived for reference
- [ ] Comparison report shows > 95% overall parity

### Per-Screen Criteria

For each screen to pass:

- [ ] Layout structure identical
- [ ] Spacing matches design tokens
- [ ] Colors match exactly (hex values)
- [ ] Typography hierarchy correct
- [ ] Border radius consistent
- [ ] Icons same size and color
- [ ] Buttons styled identically
- [ ] Cards match React frontend

## What to Verify

### 10 Key Screens

1. **Login Screen** - Centered layout, button styling
2. **Callback Screen** - Loading spinner, text
3. **Dashboard** - Header, navigation, stats
4. **Groups List** - Header, create button, cards/empty state
5. **Collections List** - Header, create button, cards/empty state
6. **Profile** - User info, logout button, dev tools
7. **Group Detail** (future)
8. **Collection Detail** (future)
9. **Object Detail** (future)
10. **Search** (future)

### Design System Elements

- **Typography**: 6 font sizes (10px-30px)
- **Colors**: 4 palettes (primary, accent, danger, gray)
- **Spacing**: 12 values (0-96px)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port in use | `lsof -ti :PORT \| xargs kill -9` |
| Backend not running | `cd $PROJECT && go run main.go` |
| Screenshot tool missing | Install gnome-screenshot or scrot |
| ImageMagick missing | `sudo dnf install ImageMagick` |

### Getting Help

1. Check script output for specific errors
2. Review logs in `logs/` directory
3. Consult `VISUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. Check `scripts/README.md` troubleshooting section
5. Review Cogent Core documentation
