FLIPSIDE is a melding of old style swing rhythms &amp; contemporary hip-hop production, injected with a healthy dose of bebop-era improvisation. In fact, much of FLIPSIDE began as improvisations. Many of the tracks were developed spontaneously in the studio, then later supplemented with overdubbed instrumentation, retaining the initial ideas &amp; melodies that first inspired the songs.",Narada,2005-02-15,Jazz,jazz,,10.00,,1,,,,,,,,," Not begun"," "," ",2022-08-08,1

Four time Grammy Nominee and Winner of the Best Vocal Performance Award, Tamia’s long awaited follow-up to her hit record More finds the sultry, sophisticated singer at both a creative and personal apex. The 15-song disc, Between Friends, sizzles with her trademark sensuality, but it is also buoyed by a sparkling personality that her fans don't always get to see. Like her past efforts, the disc is anchored by stunning vocal displays that rival this generation's greatest voices. The album features the hit track ""Can’t Get Enough"" which is one of the most highly anticipated songs from one of radio’s favorite artists.","Image Entertainment",2006-11-14,Pop,r&amp;b,,10.00,,1,,,,,,,,," Not begun"," "," ",2022-08-08,1

music,"Off the Wall","Michael Jackson",Michael,Jackson,7464660702,074646607022,"Off the Wall is the fifth solo studio album by Michael Jackson. It was released on August 10, 1979, following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in The Wiz. While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later.",Sony,2001-10-16,Pop,r&amp;b,,10.00,,1,,,,,,,,," Not begun"," "," ",2022-08-08,1
music,"Gershwin: Piano Concerto in F / Rhapsody in Blue / Cuban Overture","Jon Nakamatsu",Jon,Nakamatsu,93046744168,093046744168,"Jon Nakamatsu won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 1997 and has made several fine recordings since then. This all-Gershwin program is probably his finest. He plays the Piano Concerto with great rhythmic sass, the Charleston always underpinning the melodies. Rather than opt for a showy reading of this or the Rhapsody in Blue, he and conductor Jeff Tyzik emphasize the music’s sultry quality; the smoke-filled nightclub is there right alongside the concert hall at all times. The clarinet solo that opens the Rhapsody is stunningly evocative. Nakamatsu and the horn player duet with a keen jazz ear, and the solo piano work is songful and elegant. If you’re looking for fireworks, there are plenty in the Concerto’s finale – it’s a thrilling reading. The Cuban Overture, a work so familiar that it’s hard to look forward to, is given a terrific reading here by Tyzik and The Rochester Philharmonic, with the Latin percussion sounding wonderfully at home with the ""regular"" orchestra. This is a splendid release. --Robert Levine","HARMONIA MUNDI",2007-05-08,Jazz,"orchestra, piano",,10.00,,1,,,,,,,,," Not begun"," "," ",2022-08-08,1
